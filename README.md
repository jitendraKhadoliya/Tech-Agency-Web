I have developed a tech agency web application using modern web technologies such as React, React-DOM, React-Icon, React-Icons, React-Responsive-Carousel, React-Router-DOM, React-Router-Hash-Link, Sass, and SCSS. The application consists of a home page showcasing the services we offer, a contact page to reach out to us, and an about page elaborating on our services in detail.

The brand section of the web app features links to our social media platforms, while the services page lists the comprehensive range of services we offer including full-stack development, support, big community, and peer-to-peer services.

In the footer section of the web app, links to our GitHub, Instagram, and LinkedIn profiles are provided. Overall, the web app delivers a seamless user experience and provides a platform for our tech agency to showcase our services and engage with potential clients.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
